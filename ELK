Logstash : pipelines
Either it can collect data by itself - .csv, .txt
or either I can push data to logstash
1) It can work as a frontend to collect the logs and send the data to ES.
2) It can slice and dice the data or parse the data. file of 500 lines - slicing - 250lines to ES


Kibana :
1)GUI for ES and Logstash
2)Analysing the pushed data to ES
3)Visualization


GUI for ES - Cerebro
PAAS/SAAS service - Sumologic, Coralogix, Splunk
Management Overhead


Beats/Fluentbit,Filebeats,Metricsbeat :
often called as collector or pushers


100 servers
100 collectors - they can push the data to logstash

100pod - nginx+applicationcode
10pod - filebeat

curl localhost:9200/_cat/indice="intellipaat"


heat map
trendings words on twitter - 




slicing and dicing using collectors: fluentbit or beats

advantage:
save the cost of logstash

disadvantage:
in monolithic, pressure on application and can impact app








ES - it can consume 10000logs/second = index rate
collector rate = 15000logs/second
logtstash - temporary journals - pipelines

There is a competitor now for ES - Loki

ELK stack actually in production

4 logstash machines
6 elasticsearch machines - 1TB*6=6TB
1 kibana machines
